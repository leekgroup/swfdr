        hypotheses estimation

Description: This package allows users to estimate the science-wise
        false discovery rate from Jager and Leek, "Empirical estimates
        suggest most published medical research is true," 2013,
        Biostatistics, using an EM approach due to the presence of
        rounding and censoring. It also allows users to estimate the
        proportion of true null hypotheses in the presence of
        covariates, using a regression framework, as per Boca and Leek,
        "A direct approach to estimating false discovery rates conditional on 
	covariates," 2018, PeerJ.
